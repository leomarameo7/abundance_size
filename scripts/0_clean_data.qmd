## Introduction

I am doing this notebook to help me and collaborators to understand which data we have and what is the clean / wrangle actions we should do before fitting the individual size distibution (ISD) model proposed by [@wesner2024]. We have sampled the arthropod community of Switzerland streams. We used three (3) different methods, catching different insect families and natural history. The three methods from now on we defined as: `emergent_trap`, `kick_net`, `suction`.

Please remember the main questions of the research project:

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
**Main questions:**

\- Does beaver presence alter the arthropods ISD ? 

\- To what extend does anthropogenic land area mediate beaver influence on arthropods ISD ?
:::

## Emergent arthropods

We are going to load the raw data collected by Ph.D. student [Valentin Moser](https://www.wsl.ch/de/mitarbeitende/moserval/) and research assistants during June 2021 in **eight** different beaver dammed streams (@fig-moserflying) within the WSL-Eawag project: [Species interactions in beaver engineered habitats link land-water ecosystem processes](https://www.wsl.ch/de/projekte/sfsf/). They have sampled in two locations within each site: the main pond created by the beaver (i.e. `pool` factor level within the column `location`) and 500 meters upstream of that pond (i.e. `control` factor level within the column `location`).

![From Moser et al. 2025. Habitat heterogeneity and food availability in beaver-engineered streams foster bat richness, activity and feeding. *Journal of Animal Ecology*](images/RR_discussion.001-01.png){#fig-moserflying fig-align="center"}

In the folder `data/raw` you will find: `data_arthropods_flying.xlsx`

Emergent arthropods were collected by emergent traps (surface area 0.25 $m^2$) covered with 500 $\mu m$ net. White collection containers installed on top of the pyramid-shaped trap facilitated the sampling of the arthropods with a self-made aspirator.

## Macrozoobethos: kick net

The macrozoobenthos data we are going to use was collected by Ph.D student [Valentin Moser](https://www.wsl.ch/de/mitarbeitende/moserval/) , UZH Master student [Dominic Tinner](https://dominictinner.pro) and Patrick Hofmann within the WSL-Eawag project: [Species interactions in beaver engineered habitats link land-water ecosystem processes](https://www.wsl.ch/de/projekte/sfsf/). They sampled 14 streams with beaver presence across Switzerland (@fig-tinner). The streams varied in surrounding landscape (open landscape or forest), beaver pond area, and stream ecomorphology, i.e., the structural stream characteristics.

![Map of Switzerland showing the 16 sampled streams in the lowlands. Maps A and B show a more detailed visualization, focusing on streams in the western (A) and eastern (B) regions of the country. Streams sampled in 2021 are depicted red, in 2022 blue. Note that sites 15 and 16 were sampled but we lack the posterior in lab individual length estimation.

In each stream, four distinct locations were sampled: the lotic-lentic transition upstream of the dam (inflow), the stagnant water behind the dam (pond), a lotic stream section 25 m downstream of the dam (outflow), and a reach without any influence of beaver engineering (control) @fig-tinner2. The control location was located 500 metres upstream of the main dam at eight sites and 500 metres downstream at the other eight sites. This design assumed that the control location represented the stream habitats as they would have existed prior to the arrival of the beaver in the stream. This assures a comprehensive understanding of the beavers' effect on the freshwater ecosystem by comparing sections directly affected by the dams (i.e. inflow, pond, outflow) with those in their initial state (control).

![Schematic overview of the study design. This illustration depicts the arrangement of sample locations in relation to the beaver dam across the studied streams. Control reaches were set either 500 m upstream of the inflow or 500 m downstream of the outflow, with an equal distributioon of upstream and downstream control reaches across the 16 studied streams. Each sample location was sampled four time consecutively, each focusing on different microhabitats. Additionally, light blue stream colour denotes lotic (fast-flowing) conditions, while dark blue represents the lentic (standing water) conditions in ponds, signifying typical stream current velocity.

The aquatic invertebrate sampling was conducted in May/June of 2021 or 2022 with the [kick-net method](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.bafu.admin.ch/dam/bafu/de/dokumente/wasser/uv-umwelt-vollzug/methoden-zur-untersuchung-und-beurteilung-der-fliessgewaesser.pdf.download.pdf/methoden-zur-untersuchung-und-beurteilung-der-fliessgewaesser.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiBh4fwuKiPAxVa1wIHHTt2NdoQFnoECBYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1P_RymaemFv9YDq0ukSA8Z). During kick-net sampling, the collector kicks up the sediment in a 0.25 x 0.25 meter area of the stream for 20 seconds while a net is placed downstream of the sampling area to collect swirled-up invertebrates. Each sample location (e.g. inflow) was sampled four times consecutively to capture different microhabitats, with two samples in organic substrates (e.g., submerged macrophytes, roots) and two samples in non-organic substrates (e.g., gravel, sand). The content of the net was then transferred to plastic tubs, where aquatic invertebrates were picked out by hand for a duration of 15 minutes. After this time, the remaining content was washed in the stream (similar to gold panning), leaving only fine sediment with remaining individuals. This was stored together with the picked-out invertebrates in \[97% ethanol. The sampling in each stream was completed within one day, moving upstream to avoid impacting subsequent samples.

### Predictors:

#### Land use intensity

Land-use intensity data for each study site were extracted by Valentin Moser from Geodienste.ch and swisstopo.admin.ch using ARCGIS (Pro v. 2.8, Esri Inc., 2021 und QGIS 3.40 'Bratislava' 2024). A radius of 250 meters was selected around the center of each Pool and Control to avoid overlap between paired sampling areas. A visual inspection of the data showed highly reliable classification for agricultural (e.g., crop fields, pastures, areas that farmers maintain for biodiversity) and natural (e.g., forests, riparian areas) land-use. Areas without classified land-use were very often urban areas and human infrastructure, such as streets, railways, and housing. Therefore, missing data was assigned to urban land-use. [V. Moser](valentin.moser@wsl.ch) averaged the sum of agricultural, urban, and natural land-use cover types per site across Pool and Control. Finally, we aggregate agricultural and urban land cover estimates into an overall human impact variable called `human_influence`**.**

#### Stream ecomorphology

The classification of ecomorphology index considered factors such as riparian zone modifications and structural alterations of stream beds to provide an estimate of the degree of anthropogenic impact. The streams included in this study belonged to the first three of the five ecomorphology categories, ranging from near-natural (category level 1) to slightly impacted (2) and heavily impacted (3). The values for ecomorphology were retrieved for each stream from the Swiss Geoportal, specifically the map layer ‘Ecomorphology Level F – River reaches‘ ([link to access](https://www.geo.admin.ch/de/datensatz-27052021-wie-naturnah-sind-unsere-baeche-und-fluesse-oekomorphologie-stufe-f-bafu)).

### Load raw data

```{r load_macrozoo}

m = read_csv(here("data", "raw", "mzb_size_measurements.csv")) |> select(-c(author))

```

Let's load the covariates/predictors we are interested in:

```{r site_info}
# load site info 

site_info <- read_csv(here("data", "raw" , "site_info.csv")) |> 
  select (c(2:5,8,9,19,23)) |> 
  select(-c(site, sample))

```

Merge data frames:

```{r merge_macro_site}

m1 <- m  |> 
  left_join(site_info, by = "laufnummer") |> 
  select("laufnummer","site","location","taxon","family" ,"taxon_lowest","size","ecomorphology",    "area_pool")
  
```

```{r add_human_influence}

h = read_csv(here("data","raw","landuse_valentin.csv")) |> select(2,7)
# just get the unique value by site 
h_unique <- h  |> 
  distinct(site, human_influence)  |> 
  arrange(site, human_influence)

```

Merge the human influence variable derived by V. Moser to the macrozoobenthos dataframe:

```{r merge_hum_influence}

m2 <- m1  |> 
  left_join(h_unique, by = "site") 

```

Now we are going to:

-   Renames the existing `location` column to `location_old`.

-   Creates a new column `location` where the first three categories (`inflow`, `outflow`, `pool`) are all grouped under `"beaver"`, and the fourth category stays as it is.

```{r recall_location_column}

m3 <- m2 %>%
  rename(location_old = location) %>%            # keep old column
  mutate(location = ifelse(location_old %in% c("Inflow", "Outflow", "Pool"),
                           "beaver",
                           location_old)) |> # add method column 
  mutate(method = "kick_net") |> 
  rename(  order  = taxon, 
            length = size)


```

Plot the standardized human influence by site:

```{r plot_hum_influe-std}
# standardise human_influence (z-score)
h_std <- h %>%
  mutate(human_influence_std = scale(human_influence)[,1])

# plot
ggplot(h_std, aes(x = site, y = human_influence_std)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 3, shape = 21) +
geom_hline(yintercept = 0)+
  labs(
    title = "Standardised Human Influence by Site",
    x = "Site",
    y = "Human Influence (standardised)"
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

The sites with above-average human influence (\> 0) are: `r paste(h_std %>% filter(human_influence_std > 0) %>% distinct(site) %>% pull(site), collapse = ", ")`.

### Plot

```{r plot_macro}

# Alternative: side-by-side histogram (use 'dodge')

  ) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)
# Summarize stats per location
stats <- m3 %>%
  group_by(location) %>%
  summarise(

    mean_size = mean(length, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_size = sd(length, na.rm = TRUE),

    justification = -0.1,
    point_interval = mean_qi,  
    alpha = 0.7
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = stats,
    aes(
      x = 20,                # fixed at 20 mm
      y = location,          # map y to location
      label = paste0("n=", n, "\nmean=", round(mean_size,1),
                     "\nsd=", round(sd_size,1),
                     "\nmedian=", round(median_size,1))
    ),
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    hjust = 0,

  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Size Distributions by Location",
    y = "Location",
    x = "Size (mm)"
  ) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 14)

```

Save the data to `processed` folder

```{r save_macro_to_processed}

write.csv(m3, here( "data","processed", "m3.csv"  ))

```

### From length to dry weight

We are going to estimate arthropod's body mass as J. Pomeranz using taxon-­specific published length-­ weight regressions [@pomeranz2022]. Note that ISD relationships are sensitive to the under sampling of small body sizes. [@perkins2018] sampled benthic macroinvertebrates using comparable methods and found that body sizes smaller than 0.0026 mg were under sampled. Therefore, we will set the minimum body size to 0.0026 mg estimated dry weight before estimating ISD relationships to avoid the under sam- pling of small body sizes.

#### Load processed data

```{r load_processed_macrozoobenthos}

m3 <- read_csv( here("data", "processed", "m3.csv")) 

m3  |> filter(family != taxon_lowest)

# since there are no difference between the two columns, we remove one of them 

m4 <- m3|> select(-taxon_lowest) 
```

Extract unique combination of order - family and check how many families are there.

```{r}

# Load coefficient datasets
coeff_sol <- read_csv(here("data","raw","lw","sohlstrom.csv"))
coeff_pom_raw <- read_csv(here("data","raw","lw","LW_coeffs.csv"))

# Unique family levels
levels_m4 <- unique(m4$family)
levels_sol <- unique(coeff_sol$family)
levels_pom <- unique(coeff_pom_raw$family)

# Total families in m4
total_m4 <- length(levels_m4)

# Count matches
matches_sol <- length(intersect(levels_m4, levels_sol))
matches_pom <- length(intersect(levels_m4, levels_pom))

# Print results
cat("Total number of families in m4:", total_m4, "\n")

## Terrestrial arthropods: suction

This data was collected by Ph.D student Valentin Moser and Master students in 2021 and 2022 within 16 different streams in Switzerland. They sampled terrestrial arthropods by using a 5 x 1 m plot located one meter from the stream's edge in the center of the beaver pool and control area. Within each plot, they sampled the arthropods at the two ends of the 5 x 1 m plot in cylindrical baskets (50 cm diameter, 67 cm height, woven fabric) using suction sampling on a sunny day between 10:00-17:00 during peak arthropod activity. The samples were stored in ethanol, individuals were counted, measured and identified to order level with the help of a binocular.

### Load raw data

```{r load_terrestrial_art_data}
